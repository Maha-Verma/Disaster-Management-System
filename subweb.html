           Natural disasters are extreme events caused by natural forces that result in significant damage or loss. Examples include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, and floods. These events can have devastating impacts on human lives, infrastructure, and the environment. Understanding their causes, such as tectonic movements or climate conditions, and preparing for them through early warning systems and emergency plans is crucial for minimizing their effects. </p>
